# DailyPlannerApp
A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.

## Description
A timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. 
This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. 
It has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

## Usage
The app displays the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner.
It presents timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
Each timeblock is color-coded based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
The app allows a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock.
It then saves the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.
Events persist between refreshes of a page.
